## Development

This project uses [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for running tests and
other things (style check, coverage reports).

It is recommended to install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
along with [tox-conda](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda) for using tox.
Afterwards, `tox` command will run all the steps for you.

This project strictly uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) as an opinionated code style.
Any written line should comply with that (donâ€™t forget to run `black .` for PRs).
